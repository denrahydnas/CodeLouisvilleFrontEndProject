Front End cohort project 2016


I'm working on a site for the Louisville Rotaract Club. It's very much a work in progress, but I'm learning a lot as I go. 
Over the 12 weeks of the cohort I'm also production managing 3 shows for the Louisville Ballet in my day job - possibly not the best idea I've ever had to take so much on in 12 weeks. So far I've been able to balance both work and coding - I hope someday I can combine them!
Please check out my code and let me know if you see me heading down the wrong path. 

Thanks!
