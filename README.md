# CodeLouisvilleProject
Front End cohort project 2016
I'm working on a site for Louisville Rotaract. It's very much a work in progress, but I'm learning a lot. 
At the same time I'm also producing 3 shows for the Louisville Ballet while doing the cohort - possibly not the best idea I've ever had. 
Please check out my code and let me know if you see me heading down the wrong path. 

Thanks!
