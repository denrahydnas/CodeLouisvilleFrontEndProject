# CodeLouisvilleProject
Front End cohort project 2016


I'm working on a site for the Louisville Rotaract Club. It's very much a work in progress, but I'm learning a lot as I go. 
Over the 12 weeks of the cohort I've also production managed 3 shows for the Louisville Ballet -  it's been a lot to take on in 12 weeks, but I've enjoyed all of the challenges. So far I've been able to balance both work and coding - I hope someday I can combine them!

Thanks!
