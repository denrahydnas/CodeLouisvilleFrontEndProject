# CodeLouisvilleProject
Front End cohort project 2016


I'm working on a site for the Louisville Rotaract Club. I feel like I could keep working and learning more to implement in the project, but I'm proud of what I've accomplished. 

Over the 12 weeks of the cohort I've also production managed 3 shows for the Louisville Ballet. I've had a wonderful career in technical theatre but I am ready for a career change. I started learning to code about a year ago and was excited to hear about (and qualify for) the Code Louisville Program. Between the Ballet and CL, it's been a lot to take on in 12 weeks, but I've enjoyed figuring it all out. So far I've been able to balance both work and coding - I hope someday I can combine them!

Thanks!

Sandy
